# Corgis: Short Legs, Big Hearts üêï

An interactive single-page website celebrating everything corgi! Built with React, TypeScript, and lots of love for these adorable short-legged companions.

## Features

- **Comprehensive GA4 Tracking**: Every meaningful interaction sends custom events to Google Analytics 4

## GA4 Setup

1. Replace `G-XXXXXXX` in `index.html` with your actual Google Analytics 4 tracking ID
